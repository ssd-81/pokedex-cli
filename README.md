# üêæ pokedex-cli

A command-line Pokedex tool written in Go that interacts with the PokeAPI to fetch and explore Pok√©mon data. It handles API requests, unmarshals JSON responses, supports paginated listings, and displays Pok√©mon details in an interactive terminal experience. Built using Go‚Äôs standard libraries, it includes basic testing and planned caching features for better performance.
